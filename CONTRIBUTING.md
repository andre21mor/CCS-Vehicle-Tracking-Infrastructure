## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools
terraform >= 1.0
aws-cli >= 2.0
git >= 2.0
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-tracking-infrastructure
cd vehicle-tracking-infrastructure

# Set up remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-org/vehicle-tracking-infrastructure

# Create development environment
cp terraform.tfvars.dev terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform plan
```

## Coding Standards

### Terraform Code Style
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use variables for reusable values
- Follow module structure patterns
- Include proper resource tags

### Example Terraform Style
```hcl
# Good
resource "aws_lambda_function" "vehicle_processor" {
  function_name = "${var.environment}-vehicle-processor"
  runtime       = "python3.9"
  handler       = "index.handler"
  
  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name = "Vehicle Processor"
    Type = "Lambda Function"
  })
}

# Avoid
resource "aws_lambda_function" "func1" {
  function_name = "func1"
  runtime = "python3.9"
  handler = "index.handler"
}
```

### Python Code Style (Lambda Functions)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use logging instead of print statements

### Documentation Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Update README when adding features
- Document architectural decisions

## Testing Guidelines

### Infrastructure Testing
```bash
# Validate Terraform syntax
terraform validate

# Check formatting
terraform fmt -check

# Plan without applying
terraform plan
```

### Lambda Function Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Check code coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Design Principles
1. **Serverless First**: Prefer managed services
2. **Security by Design**: Implement least privilege
3. **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize costs
4. **Scalability**: Design for growth
5. **Observability**: Include monitoring and logging

### Module Structure
```
modules/module-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf          # Primary resources
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf     # Input variables
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf       # Output values
