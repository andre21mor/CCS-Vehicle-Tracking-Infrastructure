# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Serverless-First Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
Need to choose compute platform for vehicle tracking system with requirements for high availability, scalability, and cost efficiency.

### Decision
Adopt serverless-first architecture using AWS Lambda for all compute workloads.

### Rationale
- **Zero server management**: No infrastructure maintenance overhead
- **Automatic scaling**: Handles traffic spikes without manual intervention
- **Pay-per-execution**: Cost-effective for variable workloads
- **High availability**: Built-in fault tolerance across AZs

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Reduced operational overhead, automatic scaling, cost efficiency
- **Negative**: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, debugging complexity
- **Mitigation**: Provisioned concurrency for critical functions, comprehensive monitoring

## ADR-002: DynamoDB as Primary Database

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
Need to select database technology for high-throughput IoT data with unpredictable access patterns.

### Decision
Use Amazon DynamoDB as the primary database with separate tables per domain.

### Rationale
- **Serverless**: No database administration required
- **Performance**: Single-digit millisecond latency
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Integration**: Native integration with Lambda and API Gateway

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High performance, automatic scaling, managed service
- **Negative**: NoSQL limitations, eventual consistency, cost at scale
- **Mitigation**: Careful data modeling, use of GSIs, monitoring costs

## ADR-003: Multi-Tenant Authentication Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
System needs to support different user types (fleet managers, drivers, customers) with different access patterns and security requirements.

### Decision
Implement separate Cognito User Pools for different user types with role-based access control.

### Rationale
- **Security isolation**: Different pools prevent cross-contamination
- **Flexibility**: Different authentication requirements per user type
- **Compliance**: Easier to meet regulatory requirements
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling per user type

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enhanced security, compliance readiness, flexible authentication
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, multiple pools to manage
- **Mitigation**: Standardized IAM policies, automated pool management

## ADR-004: Event-Driven Architecture with Kinesis

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
Need to process real-time telemetry data from thousands of vehicles with low latency and high throughput.

### Decision
Implement event-driven architecture using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time processing.

### Rationale
- **Real-time processing**: Sub-second latency for critical events
- **Decoupling**: Producers and consumers are independent
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on throughput
- **Durability**: Data retention for replay and recovery

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Real-time capabilities, system decoupling, fault tolerance
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, eventual consistency challenges
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive monitoring, error handling, dead letter queues

## ADR-005: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
Need to ensure consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure deployments across environments.

### Decision
Use Terraform as the primary Infrastructure as Code tool with modular architecture.

### Rationale
- **Multi-cloud compatibility**: Not locked to AWS-specific tools
- **Mature ecosystem**: Large community and provider support
- **State management**: Centralized state tracking
- **Modularity**: Reusable components across environments

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent deployments, version control, multi-cloud ready
- **Negative**: Learning curve, state management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Team training, remote state backend, automated testing

## ADR-006: Modular Architecture Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
Need to organize infrastructure code for maintainability, reusability, and team collaboration.

### Decision
Implement modular architecture with 13 specialized Terraform modules.

### Rationale
- **Separation of concerns**: Each module has single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Modules can be used across environments
- **Team collaboration**: Different teams can work on different modules
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested independently

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better organization, reusability, parallel development
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, module dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Clear module interfaces, dependency documentation

## ADR-007: Cost Optimization Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Deciders**: CloudOps Architecture Team  

### Context
Need to balance performance requirements with cost efficiency for competitive pricing.

### Decision
Implement serverless-first architecture with pay-per-use pricing model and proactive cost monitoring.

### Rationale
- **Variable costs**: Pay only for actual usage
- **No idle resources**: Serverless eliminates idle compute costs
- **Automatic scaling**: Resources scale down during low usage
- **Monitoring**: Proactive cost tracking and optimization

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Cost efficiency, automatic optimization, predictable scaling costs
- **Negative**: Potential for unexpected costs, complexity in cost prediction
- **Mitigation**: Cost alerts, regular optimization reviews, reserved capacity where appropriate
